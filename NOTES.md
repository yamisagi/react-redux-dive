### <span style="color: #c1121f;"> _What is Redux?_</span>

**Redux** is a state management library. It is used to manage the state of an application. **Redux** provides a predictable state container for JavaScript applications. It is commonly used with libraries like React to efficiently manage the state of an application in a centralized manner. The core principles of Redux revolve around maintaining the application state in a single store, ensuring that state changes are handled through predictable actions, and employing pure functions called reducers to update the state.

Redux inspired from **Flux**.

Like Flux, Redux prescribes that you concentrate your model update logic in a certain layer of your application (‚Äústores‚Äù in Flux, ‚Äúreducers‚Äù in Redux). Instead of letting the application code directly mutate the data, both tell you to describe every mutation as a plain object called an ‚Äúaction‚Äù.

<a href="https://redux.js.org/understanding/history-and-design/prior-art#flux" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: semi-bold;">But difference from **Flux** is that **Redux** assumes you never mutate your data. You can use plain objects and arrays for your state just fine, but mutating them inside the reducers is strongly <span style="color: #c1121f;">**discouraged**</span>. You should always return a new object, which can be done using the (‚Ä¶) object spread operator.</a>

**React-Redux** is a package which is used to connect the Redux with React. So we can understand that Redux is not only for React. We can use Redux with any other framework or library. It has one store which is a globalized state. And we can access this state from anywhere in the application. And we can update the state using 'dispatch' method.

But Important thing is that in Redux,<span style="color: #c1121f;"> _we can not directly update the state of Components_</span>. We have to dispatch an action to update the state.

And reducer is not a hook which we have in React 'useReducer'.

One more thing is 'Store' concept in Redux, gives subscription to the components. So, whenever the state changes, the components will be updated automatically.

---

### <span style="color: #c1121f;"> _**Core concepts of Redux are**_</span>

<br/>

1. <span style="color: #ef233c;">**Store**</span>

```javascript
// Create a store using 'createStore' method from 'redux' package.
// We have to pass a reducer as an argument to the createStore method.
// And we can also pass preloadedState as an argument to the createStore method.
// Which can be came from the localStorage or from the server.

const store = createStore(reducer, preloadedState);
```

<br/>

2. <span style="color: #ef233c;">**Action**</span>

```javascript
// Actions are usuallly an object which contains a type and payload.
// Type is the name of the action and payload is the data which is passed to the reducer. Payload is optional. We can pass any data to the reducer.

const action = {
  type: 'ADD',
  payload: 10,
};

// And Action Creator is a function which returns an action.
// We can use 'useDispatch' hook to dispatch an action for React.
// But we can not use 'useDispatch' hook outside of the React. So, we can use 'store.dispatch' method to dispatch an action.

dispatch(action); // We can use like this if we are using 'useDispatch' hook.

store.dispatch({ type: 'ADD', payload: 10 });
store.dispatch({ type: 'SUBTRACT', payload: 5 });

// But for better understanding, nowadays we are using React or any other framework or library with Redux.

/* 

If we are not using React or any other framework or library with Redux,

We need to use older ways because for example in React we have simple way 
to dispatch an action using 'useDispatch' hook to handle all stuffs behind the scenes. 

For non specific framework or library we have to use 'store.subscribe' method to subscribe the components to the store. 

So, we are subscribing the components to the store using 'store.subscribe' method. And we are getting the state using 'store.getState' method.

*/

// Like thisüëáüèª

const subscription = () => {
  console.log('State updated', store.getState());
};

store.subscribe(subscription);
```

<br/>

3. <span style="color: #ef233c;">**Reducer**</span>

```javascript
// Reducer is a function which takes the current state and action as an argument and returns the new state. Reducer is the only thing which can update the state.

// And also we can pass initial state as default value of the state.

//! IMPORTANT: We usually use Object as a state. Object is a reference type. So, we have to return a new object. We never mutate the state, we always return a new state.

// Objects & Arrays are working in HEAP. But Primitives are working in STACK.
// Thats the difference between them. Short explanation is, HEAP is a big memory space. An Object variable knows the pointer which is in STACK.
// And this pointer is pointing to address of the Object in HEAP. So, when we create a new Object, we are creating a new pointer in STACK but it still points to the same address in HEAP.

// So for example take a look at this üëáüèª

// https://gist.github.com/yamisagi/cf858327ec4690344b79b836921c3e27

const initialState = {
  counter: 0,
};

const reducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'ADD':
      // We are returning a new object here. Because we never mutate the state.
      return {
        // We are spreading the state here. 
        // Because we could have more than one state in a Object and we want to copy all of them.
        ...state,
        counter: state.counter + action.payload,
      };
    case 'SUBTRACT':
      return {
        ...state,
        counter: state.counter - action.payload,
      };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};
```

## <span style="color: #c1121f;">NOTE</span> : Redux createStore() is (not) deprecated

**React Redux** team now recommends the usage of an extra package called Redux Toolkit and another way of creating the Redux store. But, the createStore() method is not deprecated. It is still available in the Redux package.

---

### <span style="color: #c1121f;"> _**How to use Redux in React?**_</span>

<br/>

As we see in the above example, we have to create a store using '**createStore**' method from '**redux**' package. And we have to pass a reducer as an argument to the createStore method. And we can also pass **preloadedState** as an argument to the createStore method. Which can be came from the localStorage or from the server.

---

And we have to wrap our application with '**Provider**' component from 'react-redux' package. And we have to pass the store as a prop to the '**Provider**' component. Usually we wrap our **Provider** component with the **root** component of our application.

```javascript
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';

// Can be imported from the same file or from another file.

import reducer from './reducer';

const store = createStore(reducer, preloadedState);

ReactDOM.render(
  <Provider store={store}>
    <App />
  </Provider>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

---

And we have to use '**useSelector**' hook to get the state from the store. And we have to use '**useDispatch**' hook to dispatch an action to the reducer.

```javascript
import { useSelector, useDispatch } from 'react-redux';

const App = () => {
  // useSelector is a hook which is used to get the state from the store.
  const state = useSelector((state) => state.counter);

  // useDispatch is a hook which is used to dispatch an action to the reducer.
  const dispatch = useDispatch();

  //! Types of actions are coming from the reducer that we added above. (ADD, SUBTRACT)

  //! Payload is the data which is passed to the reducer. (10, 5)

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{state.counter}</h1>

      {/* dispatch an action to the reducer */}

      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'ADD', payload: 10 })}>
        Add
      </button>

      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'SUBTRACT', payload: 5 })}>
        Subtract
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

---

<br/>

### <span style="color: #c1121f;"> _**How to use Redux in Class-based Components?**_</span>

<br/>

We can use '**connect**' method from 'react-redux' package to connect the Redux with Class-based Components. Because we can not use hooks in Class-based Components.

---

- For example, we have a class-based component called '**Counter**'. And we have to **connect** this component with **Redux**.

```javascript

import { connect } from 'react-redux';

class Counter extends React.Component {

  const handleAdd = () => {
   // If we were using 'dispatch' in mapDispatchToProps, we could use like this üëáüèª

   //* this.props.dispatch({ type: 'ADD', payload: 10 });

   // But we are using 'increment' in mapDispatchToProps, so we have to use like this üëáüèª

    this.props.increment();
};

  const handleSubtract = () => {

    // Same as above üëÜüèª
    // this.props.dispatch({ type: 'SUBTRACT', payload: 5 });

    this.props.decrement();
  };

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>{this.props.state.counter}</h1>
        <button onClick={this.handleAdd.bind(this)}>
          Add
        </button>

        <button onClick={this.handleSubtract.bind(this)}>
          Subtract
        </button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

// mapStateToProps is a function which is used to get the state from the store.

const mapStateToProps = (state) => {
  return {
    state: state.counter,
  };
};

// mapDispatchToProps is a function which is used to dispatch an action to the reducer.

const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => {
  return {
    // dispatch: dispatch, // We can use like this.
    // Or we can use like this üëáüèª
    // This is cleaner way to use dispatch to me for simple applications.
    increment: () => dispatch({ type: 'ADD', payload: 10 }),
    decrement: () => dispatch({ type: 'SUBTRACT', payload: 5 }),
  };
};


// connect is a method which is used to connect the Redux with Class-based Components. And it takes two arguments.

//First one is mapStateToProps and second one is mapDispatchToProps.

// So first one is used to get the state from the store. And second one is used to dispatch an action to the reducer.

// Like useSelector and useDispatch hooks in React.

// This usage is called 'Decorator' in React or Higher Order Component (HOC).

// We can use like this üëáüèª

//? How this HOC works ?
//? It takes the Counter component as an argument
//? And returns the new component with the props which we passed to the connect method.

export default connect(mapStateToProps,mapDispatchToProps)(Counter);
